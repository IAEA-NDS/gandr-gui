GANDR GUI Development

This is a repository for a GANDR GUI, currently in development.
[GANDR](https://www-nds.iaea.org/gandr) is an IAEA Nuclear Data development
project.

To compile, install gcc, make and the wxWidgets 3 development libraries 
and run `make`.

On windows, a pre-defined VS project is prepared. The user is expected to 
modify the path to the wxWidgets installation.

The goal of this GUI is not to support the full functionality of GANDR, or 
at least not in the first iteration, but to provide a simple interface for 
the common use cases.
